This project presents a data-driven analysis of the Top 10 E-Commerce Companies in India, focusing on key performance metrics such as monthly website traffic, estimated Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), customer reviews, and overall market presence. The primary objective of this project is to apply real-world data analytics techniques to compare leading Indian e-commerce platforms and extract meaningful insights about their performance and competitiveness.

The data used in this project was collected from publicly available and reliable online sources. After collection, the data was carefully cleaned, validated, and standardized to ensure accuracy and fair comparison across all companies included in the analysis. This preprocessing step was essential to maintain consistency and reliability in the results.

Google Looker Studio was used to design and develop an interactive dashboard that visually represents the analyzed data. The dashboard enables users to explore trends, compare companies across multiple metrics, and gain a clear understanding of market dominance and performance differences within the Indian e-commerce ecosystem.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical skills in data collection, data preprocessing, visualization, and insight generation. It has been developed for academic evaluation, portfolio building, and presentation to recruiters, sponsors, and industry professionals interested in data-driven business analysis.
